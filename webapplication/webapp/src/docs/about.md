# About this tool

This page provides tools to work with a number of mathematical models.
The page is set up to support the course 5xie0, Computational Modeling.

For more information visit the web page <https://computationalmodeling.info>.


## Components

The CMWB is built from a few open-source components that are ll available on github
<https://github.com/Model-Based-Design-Lab>

- `cmlib` is a collection of Python packages that implement the analysis methods of the different models, as exposed through the CMWB
- `cmlang` is a collection of parser-generators, code-generators and language servers for the domain-specific languages used in this project, based on Xtext.
- `cmtrace` is a tool to generate visualizations of Gantt charts and vector traces
- `cmwb` is the open source project of the CMWB itself. This also allows the CMWB to run locally, though a docker image.
